There is an associate GUI that\r\nruns on the local computer, or you can simply connect to the Arduino with a\r\nserial console (9600 baud) and send it commands.\r\n\r\nThis is a quick hack for some electrophysiology work being done in our lab, but\r\nif you need specific features please request them by opening a new issue on\r\ngithub.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding\r\n========\r\n\r\nThe arduino firmware can be built by opening\r\nPulseGeneratorFirmware/PulseGenerator.pde in the Arduino environment.\r\nAlternatively, the included firmware/Makefile will build and upload (using\r\n\"make upload\") the firmware for the arduino on Ubuntu 12.10; other systems\r\nmay need some modifications to the makefile.\r\n\r\nThe GUI can be built by running \"qmake\" and \"make\" in the project directory\r\n(after installing Qt).\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n=====\r\n\r\nPulse sequences are defined by simple programs.  For example, the following\r\nprogram will generate 15 ms pulses on channel 1 for 3 seconds::\r\n\r\n    change channel 1 to repeat 15 ms on 85 ms off\r\n    wait 3 s\r\n    turn off channel 1\r\n    end\r\n\r\nChannels 1, 2, 3, and 4 are mapped to arduino pins 2, 3, 4 and 5\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\nArduinoPulseGeneratorGui is released under a GPLv3 License (see the file\r\n\"COPYING\" for details).\r\n\r\n"}
